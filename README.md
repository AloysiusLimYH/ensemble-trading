Improving stock prediction with ensemble trade strategies

Identifying the challenge that individual trading strategies can sometimes produce false signals, we propose an approach that addresses this problem by transforming it into a machine learning supervised classification task, with the goal of identifying 'perfect' trading signals. To overcome these limitations, our solution involves the integration of ensemble models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking classifiers. These ensemble models collaboratively leverage the strengths of individual strategies to create a more accurate and robust trading system.
